Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a developer, somewhat of a researcher, and recovering economics student

* Born and raised in [Thane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thane)
* Started Computer Engineering at [Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT)](https://pict.edu)
* Built robots and competed in [Robocon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocon_India) 
at [PICT Robotics](https://www.instagram.com/pictrobotics/?hl=en)
* Graduated from PICT
* Had awesome time building ML algorithms for trucks and buses at [Intangles](https://intangles.ai)
* Started volunteering with [ASAR for India](https://www.asarforindia.org/) doing data analysis 
and tech work for public health - still going strong
* COVID lockdown got me into microecon and game theory on Coursera, 
totally changed my perspective
* This led me to Duke's [MSEC](https://econ.duke.edu/masters-programs/degree-programs/msec) 
program - economics meets computer science
* Building entertaining and safe AI-powered talking toys at [Curio](https://heycurio.com/)
